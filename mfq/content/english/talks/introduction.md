### MathFoundQ's "Nonlocal Talks" are online talks in which our guests will discuss themes related to quantum foundations and quantum information. They will happen on Thursdays at 11am (GMT-3), on dates that will be listed in this page and published on our [Twitter account](http://www.twitter.com/MathFoundQ). If you see something of your interest, we invite you to join our discussions! Just **[drop us an e-mail](mailto:MathFoundQ@unicamp.br) and we'll send you the link.**
