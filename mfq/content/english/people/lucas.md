I have a Physics degree from The Universidade Federal do Paraná, and Currently I am a master degree student in the Universidade Estadual de Campinas. I have worked with foundations of quantum mechanics, developing projects related to the quantum behavior of light and Bell's Inequalities for continous variables. Nowadays I have been studying entropy criteria for the causality principle.
